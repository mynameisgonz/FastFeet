# FastFeet
 
To install, download the files above and drop them in your Windower/Addon folder.

In game, load the addon using the command: //lua l fastfeet 

To set the item you want to equip when moving, use the command: //ff set "Item"
example: //ff set "Herald's Gaiters"
note: Double Quotes are necessary when item has commas or special characters. Capitalization is also important.

Addon will simply run. No need to start stop. It will attempt to re-equip whatever previous item was equipped in that slot. As such, ensure you equip a piece in that slot at some point to register it into memory.
It will dynamically update as you swap gear.
